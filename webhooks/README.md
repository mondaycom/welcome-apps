This video (link) explains the basics of monday.com webhooks and how they work. The webhook integration allows you to subscribe to certain events on your monday.com board. Your app will receive a notification when these events happen so your app can react to those events.

Here's an example that you can follow to add a webhook to your board.

Before adding the webhook, follow these steps:

1. Find a monday.com board that you can run tests on.
2. Install an IDE of your choice (we are using Visual Studio Code).
3. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
4. Download this repository.
5. In the terminal, run "npm install" in the repository's root folder.
6. Follow the instructions in the video.
